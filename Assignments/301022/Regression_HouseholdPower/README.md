Regression: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption

Steps:
1. Data ingestion
2. EDA
3. Preprocessing
4. Pickling for the preprocessing object(save the preprocessing model)
5. After preprocessing you have to store data inside MONGODB
6. You have to load the data from mongo db

Model Regression:
1. Linear regression
2. Ridge regression
3. Lasso regression
4. Elastic net
5. Support vector regression

Hyperparameter tuning is mandatory(GRID SEARCH CV)

Evaluation of the model
Regression evaluation matrix: R2 and adjusted R2
